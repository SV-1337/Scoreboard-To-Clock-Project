# Scoreboard-To-Clock-Project

A basketball scoreboard was repurposed into a clock.
- The top two pairs of digits were used to represent the hour and minutes respectively.
- The bottom two pairs of digits were used to represent the month and day respectively.
- The colored lights above Period were used to signify the season of the year, with the first light representing spring, the second one representing summer, the third one representing autumn, and the fourth one representing winter.
- The visitor light was used to indicate AM time, and the home light was used to indicate PM time.
- Hardware modifications were made to the scoreboard in order to install new drivers and wiring.
- Buttons were added to the top of the scoreboard so that the user of the clock could alter the time at certain moments, such as daylight saving.
